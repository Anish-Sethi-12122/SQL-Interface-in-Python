# _🛡️SQL Interface in Python_  
Everyone who has ever used MySQL has defenitely fallen in love with the MySQL terminal's simplicity and light-weight clean UI. This small python code replicates that exact experience (with a little Python touch) in the Python terminal.

Simple and lightweight.  
Just like MySQL terminal.

Copy-paste the following command to your terminal and click enter --  
`python main.py`

Log in with your MySQL Password (change host, and user if not set to default "localhost" and "root") and boom, start working with SQL right away.
